The unbeaten SMOKE ON THE WATER (5) returns after nearly fourteen months off the scene. Could not have been more impressive in that maiden campaign.

Kept up to the mark with a 795m trial placing and adept in all conditions. Respect. WELL TIMED (13) talented gelding destined for better things. Sat on the strong tempo when resuming with a gallant second over 1400m in the Prov Mid Champs at Hawkesbury. Reunited with Rawiller and looks excellent each way value. THUNDERLIPS (16) progressive gelding resuming. Went quickly through his grades last time in and fitted with the two searching trials. Watch for him late. KIBOU (4) nice effort first up when collared late by General Salute over 1200m at Kembla Grange. Back in grade and the extra trip is in his favour. Worthy contender who will hold a forward position."
